# ðŸ’¡ Introduction to SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of software design guidelines aimed at improving code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
   Every class should have a single responsibility and only one reason to change. This ensures classes remain focused and easy to maintain.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  
   Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This promotes code reusability and reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding new features.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
   Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures consistent behavior across different implementations.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
   Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. This encourages the creation of smaller, more focused interfaces.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
   High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than low-level modules. This promotes a decoupled architecture and enhances code flexibility.
